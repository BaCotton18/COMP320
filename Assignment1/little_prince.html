<p1>As the little prince drifted off to sleep, I took him into my arms and set out walking once more.</p1>
<p2> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</p2>
<p3> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</p3>
<p1> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind,
    and I said to myself:</p1>
<p4> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</p4>
<p1> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself again:</p1>
<p4> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower -- the image of
    a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</p4>
<p1> And I felt him to be more fragile still.</p1>
<p2> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</p2>
